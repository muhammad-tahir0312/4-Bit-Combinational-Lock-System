- **University:** National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences-FAST, Karachi Campus

## Project Description

The 4 Bit Combinational Lock System is implemented using XOR gates and a universal NOR gate. XOR gates act as comparators to verify the entered key against the lock key. Upon correct entry, a green LED lights up; otherwise, an alarm system is triggered. This project explores fundamental digital logic concepts, logic gates, combinational circuit implementation, and comparator functionality.

## Components Used

- XOR Gates
- NOR Gates
- LEDs
- Resistors
- DIP Switches
- Diodes (1N914)
- Jumper Wires
- Push Switch
- Batteries

## Procedure

1. Set the power supply to 9 volts and provide voltage and ground connections to the breadboard.
2. Connect voltage to each "key code" switch and "data entry switch".
3. Connect each "key code" switch to designated pins of the XOR gate and similarly connect "data entry switch" to other pins of the XOR gate.
4. Attach 10kΩ resistors to each switch and connect them to ground.
5. Connect the outputs from the XOR gates to 1N914 diodes.
6. Further connect the diodes to 10kΩ resistors and ground.
7. Connect specific pins of the diodes to the NOR gate and resistors.
8. Connect the pushbutton switch to ground.
9. Connect LEDs with resistors to display outputs based on gate operations.

## Applications

The project demonstrates practical applications of digital logic in security systems. Such systems are crucial in industries like home security (e.g., Ring systems) where logic gates are used extensively for access control and alarm systems.
